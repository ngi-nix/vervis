For a summary of releases and user visible changes, see `NEWS.md`.

The changes are recorded by the version control system, Darcs. To see a log
quickly from the terminal, run:

    $ darcs log --repo <REPO URL>

There is also a web interface there which, among other things, can display the
history log.

To see the log in a local clone, first get a copy of the repository if you
haven't yet:

    $ darcs clone <REPO URL>

Then move into the newly created directory and run darcs:

    $ cd vervis
    $ darcs log

See the project description cabal file for the repository URL.
