-- | This is code code shared between SQL and PostgreSQL modules. Currentl it
-- exists just for the table and column quoting. If we discover that this code
-- is corrent only for PostgreSQL and other DBMSs have their own rules, then
-- the code below should probably move back to PostgreSQL module and then this
-- Internal module is not needed at all.
