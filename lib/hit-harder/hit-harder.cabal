synopsis:            More Git tools in pure Haskell on top of 'git'
description:
  During my work on a Haskell implementation of the Git pack protocol, which is
  still in progress at the time of writing, I've been writing various general
  purpose utilities. At the beginning I just dumped them into Util modules, but
  at some point the collection of utils felt too useful to be kept like that,
  and I decided to create a separate package for them.
