This library is free software, and is committed to software freedom. It is
released to the public domain using the CC0 Public Domain Dedication. For the
boring "legal" details see the file `COPYING`.

To build the library, run `stack build` in the repo directory. You may run
`stack setup` first to install GHC. You can play with the library on the GHCi
interactive interpreter via `stack repl`.

The file `CHANGELOG.md` provides a friendly overview of the changes for each
release.
