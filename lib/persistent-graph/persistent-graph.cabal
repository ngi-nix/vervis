name:                persistent-graph
version:             0.1
synopsis:            Representing, querying and editing graphs with Persistent
description:
  This library extends the functionality of the API provided in the
  [persistent](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) package, with
  the ability to represent graphs in persistent entities. The records are the
  graph nodes, and a field that is a self reference (i.e. it's an ID referring
  to a record in the same entity as the reference itself) is used for defining
  graph edges. Persisent backends that support recursive queries (such as graph
  databases, and some SQL databases, e.g. PostgreSQL) can then be used for
  traversing the graph.
  .
  You can think of this library as
  "[FGL](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) for persistent", i.e.
  a graph library in which the manipulated graph is stored in a database.
  .
  It's useful for working with hierarchical data without having to write long
  unreadable database-specific queries.
  .
  Note that persistent backends that don't support recursive queries can still
  implement this interface, by reading the whole graph into memory and
  performing graph algorithms on the Haskell side.
  .
  COPYING NOTE: While my code is in the public domain, this library contains
  code under MIT which is copied from the persistent package.
