synopsis:            Some tools for working with Darcs repos
description:
  The API is currently unstable and should be properly organized and
  documented. But otherwise, basically, this library is an API for working with
  Darcs repositories. It's a collection of tools I wrote for a repository
  hosting web application. It's not polished right now and doesn't have its own
  plan for a complete feature set. I just add stuff when I need it. But I hope
  to gradually polish and document it, and maybe it can even be useful somehow
  to the actual Darcs project.
  .
  In case you wonder how this library started, here's the story:
  .
  In 2016 I started working on a web application, and I wanted it to be able to
  display some info about Darcs repositories. To avoid having to run the
  @darcs@ program on every request, I went to the @darcs@ package to check if
  some functions from there could help me. All the complicated type stuff there
  scared me (and maybe still does haha), so I decided to try challenging myself
  a bit as a novice Haskeller and wrote a little Attoparsec parser that
  reads the information directly from the @_darcs/@ directory.
