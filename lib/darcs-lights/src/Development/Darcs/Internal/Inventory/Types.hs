-- TODO
--
-- Apparently, after a while, some of the patches are moved from
-- hashed_inventory into the inventories/ dir. So the patch set contains more
-- than one group. This means I need to extend my parser to cover this case.
-- Sources for info about this thing:
--
-- * Darcs source code
-- * Darcs wiki
-- * Local Darcs repos I have
--
-- From Darcs source code:
--
-- > The patches in a repository are stored in chunks broken up at \"clean\"
-- > tags. A tag is clean if the only patches before it in the current
-- > repository ordering are ones that the tag depends on (either directly
-- > or indirectly). Each chunk is stored in a separate inventory file on disk.
-- >
-- > A 'PatchSet' represents a repo's history as the list of patches since the
-- > last clean tag, and then a list of patch lists each delimited by clean tags.
-- >
-- > A 'Tagged' is a single chunk of a 'PatchSet'.  It has a 'PatchInfo'
-- > representing a clean tag, the hash of the previous inventory (if it exists),
-- > and the list of patches since that previous inventory.
--
-- Let's start with finding out the format of the binary inventories and
-- parsing them.
