-- | This message contains two parts.
--
-- The first part is the set of commits which will be shallow due to the depth
-- limit. These are commits which will be sent to the client (if it doesn't
-- have them), but (at least some of) their parents won't because they are too
-- deep.
--
-- Given the graph of all commits in a repo, we can determine which ones to
-- list like this:
--
-- (1) Use DFS starting with the refs the client /wants/, to determine the set
--     of commits the wants depend on
-- (2) Build a subgraph which contains only the wanted commits and their
--     dependencies, discovered in the previous step
-- (3) Use BFS on the subgraph to determine the depth of each commit
-- (4) Pick all the commits in the subgraph which are shallow, i.e. they are
--     exactly at the requested maximal depth and each of their parents is
--     either missing from the subgraph, or at depth above the maximum
--
-- The second part is the set of commits the client specified as shallow, but
-- won't be shallow anymore after the update because its parents within the
-- depth limit and therefore will be sent.
--
-- Given the graph of all commits in a repo, we can determine which ones to
-- list like this. Note that the first 3 steps are identical to the ones in the
-- first part, so we only need to perform them once.
--
-- (1) Use DFS starting with the refs the client /wants/, to determine the set
--     of commits the wants depend on
-- (2) Build a subgraph which contains only the wanted commits and their
--     dependencies, discovered in the previous step
-- (3) Use BFS on the subgraph to determine the depth of each commit
-- (4) Pick all the healthy commits in the subgraph, i.e. commits within the
--     depth limit, whose parents are present and within the depth limit as
--     well
-- (5) Find the intersection between the set of commits the client specified as
--     shallow, and the set of commits we got in the previous step
