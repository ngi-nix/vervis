-- I want to explain how the capability based types are supposed to work.
-- Basically what we have here is:
--
-- * A record to fill and use during communication
-- * Sum types which specify capability declarations
--
-- The idea is that we run like this:
--
-- (1) Start with the default record and a record expressing what is supported
-- (2) Send the differences
-- (3) Receive and parse a list of values of the sum type
-- (4) Go over the list and update the record
-- (5) Finally we have a record to use for the rest of the protocol
--
-- Since right now we're just on fetch and the capability list is hardcoded in
-- 'buildRefDiscover', the changes will be:
--
-- (1) Have 2 fields for caps, one for shared and one for fetch-specific
-- (2) Have functions for Putting caps
-- (3) Have the 2 fields hardcoded to 2 empty lists for now
