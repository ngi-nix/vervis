-- | Sometimes we need to give the user a URL with a different domain than the
-- main web application, but with the same protocol scheme: If we're running in
-- HTTPS, then provide an HTTPS URL. And if we're running plain HTTP, provide
-- an HTTP URL (not because HTTPS is bad, but because we may be serving that
-- URL too and simply not providing SSL for it).
--
-- In order to construct that URL, we need to figure out whether the request
-- we're serving is secured with HTTPS.
--
-- Since the web app may be running behind a reverse proxy, checking the
-- request itself isn't enough - we need to know whether a reverse proxy may be
-- serving our web app via HTTPS.
--
-- One way to detect that is @Forwarded@ headers in the request, but it seems
-- they can be faked, i.e. just inserted manually by an HTTP client. So our
-- approach here is to rely on the configured approot: If you use a reverse
-- proxy, specify the approot in your web app settings file, otherwise only the
-- request itself will be consulted.
--
-- UPDATE: There's no optional approot setting, we always assume HTTPS. So
-- 'getSecure' simply always returns 'True'.
