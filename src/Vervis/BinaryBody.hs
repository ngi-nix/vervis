-- | Support for working with HTTP request bodies which contain binary
-- serialization, using the @binary@ package.

-- TODO add ToContent, ToTypedContent etc. instances with Get and Put support
-- TODO rename module to Yesod.<some>.<thing>.Local
-- TODO maybe split into entirely separate small trivial package?
