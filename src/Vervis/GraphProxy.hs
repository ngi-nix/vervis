-- | Persistent graphs are specified using the 'PersistEntityGraph' typeclass,
-- using value functions which specify fields. But the DB schema is known at
-- development time, and a specific graph needs to be picked statically. Since
-- the 'persistent' package doesn't have compile-time (e.g. type-level)
-- representation of the schema (but instead converts from TH directly to
-- datatypes), the graph related functions use a 'Proxy' which specifies the
-- graph using the type.
--
-- I don't know enough about type systems and advanced type features and GHC
-- extensions, to tell whether a better solution is possible. For now, this is
-- how things work.
--
-- This module is a helper for easily specifying graphs instead of typing the
-- proxy type directly each time, which may be long and cumbersome.
