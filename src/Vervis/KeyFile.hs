-- | Initial generation of key files, and later loading them.
--
-- Some programs need to generate a file, such as a signing key, and later
-- consistently use this file for program operation. And it's critical that
-- this very same file remains available. For example, if that file is an
-- encryption key used for encrypting all program state, then losing this file
-- means losing all program state.
--
-- In such a case, you may wish to have the following behavior:
--
--   * If we're in the initial program setup step, generate key files and store
--     them somewhere (file, database, etc.)
--   * If we aren't in that step anymore, require that these files are present,
--     and load them for use in the program. If a key file is missing, don't
--     just blindly generate a new one, because we *need* it to consistently be
--     the same file we originally generated. So if it's missing, report an
--     error to the user.
--   * Have a reliable way to determine whether we're in the initial setup
--     step, and make sure it's not easy to accidentally break this detection
--
-- This module, along with "Data.KeyFile", implements such a mechanism for
-- Vervis. It's really simple:
--
--   * If there are no tables in the DB, it's the initial setup phase
--   * If initial setup, require that key file doesn't exist, and generate one
--   * If not initial setup, require that key file exists
