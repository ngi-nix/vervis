-- TODO how do I connect the layers?
--
-- Here's a suggestion. I can use rlayerWith to specify the result, and then in
-- addition to the Node, also return its out-edges. Now what remains is to
-- efficiently determine in which layer that node lives. That can be done by
-- keeping the node-to-layer map I built. But that may make the *layer*
-- function type sigs uglier, so instead I could also avoid relying on the
-- existence of such a map, and build it externally from the list of layers.
-- Yeah, sounds good to me.
--
-- However in order to find the layer quickly, it may be a good idea to put the
-- layer lists into an IntMap or HashMap for fast queries.
