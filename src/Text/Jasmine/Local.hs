-- | Some of the handler and widget utilities Yesod provides include snippets
-- of Javascript which gets inserted into the page. Usually there is no way to
-- tell these utilities not to include the script. When you don't want it to be
-- included, one way to avoid it to maintain modified versions of the
-- utilities. Another, much easier way, is to use a modified Javascript
-- minifier.
--
-- I don't know whether a modified minifier can be a good filter which discards
-- some scripts and enables others, but there's definitely one case in which it
-- works well: Discarding all scripts.
--
-- This module collects such modified minifiers.

reportm :: BL.ByteString -> Either String BL.ByteString
reportm _ = Left "The app disables all JS through the minifier"
