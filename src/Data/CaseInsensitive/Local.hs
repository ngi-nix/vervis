-- | CI views for avoiding ambiguity in the meaning of some typeclass
-- instances, and allow two instances to coexist. For example, does 'show' show
-- the original or the case-folded version? Using CI views, it's easy to
-- specify that.
--
-- Note that some of the instances provided here, i.e. instances 'CI' already
-- has, are reused directly by both views. If you aren't sure about a specific
-- instance, check the source.
