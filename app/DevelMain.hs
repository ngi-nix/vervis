-- | Running your app inside GHCi.
--
-- To start up GHCi for usage with Yesod, first make sure you are in dev mode:
--
-- > cabal configure -fdev
--
-- Note that @yesod devel@ automatically sets the dev flag.
-- Now launch the repl:
--
-- > cabal repl --ghc-options="-O0 -fobject-code"
--
-- To start your app, run:
--
-- > :l DevelMain
-- > DevelMain.update
--
-- You can also call @DevelMain.shutdown@ to stop the app
--
-- You will need to add the foreign-store package to your .cabal file.
-- It is very light-weight.
--
-- If you don't use cabal repl, you will need
-- to run the following in GHCi or to add it to
-- your .ghci file.
--
-- :set -DDEVELOPMENT
--
-- There is more information about this approach,
-- on the wiki: https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/wiki/ghci
