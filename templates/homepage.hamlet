  Vervis is a work-in-progress federated project and repository hosting and
  collaboration platform. Its development is meant to help form the ForgeFed
  specification for project hosting platform federation, and hopefully get
  existing platforms (such as Gitea, Gogs, GitLab CE, etc.) to support it.

<p>
  Vervis is being used for its own development:
